In Heaven she grew too tired and thin to sing well, and her face grew whiter than its aureole with pain and want of him.

To Lord Houghton, 31 March [1864]">To which missive of mine came a note of invitation which I answered by setting off again for his [Walter Savage Landor's] lodging. AFter losing myself for an hour in the accursed Borgo S. Frediano I found it at last, and found him as alert, brilliant and altogether delicious as i suppose others may have found him twenty years since. I cannot thank you enough for procuring me this great pleasure and exquisite satisfaction—I am seriously more obliged for this than for anything that could have been done for me. I have got the one thing I wanted with all my heart. If both or either of us die tomorrow, at least to-day he has told me that my presence here has made him happy; he said more than that—things for which of course I take no credit to myself but which are not the less pleasant to hear from such a man. There is not other man living from whom I should so much have prized any expression of acceptance or goodwill in return for my homage; for all other men as great are so much younger that in his case one sort of reverence serves as the lining for another. My grandfather was upon the whole mieux consent; but he had written no Hellenics. In answer to something that Mr. Landor said to-day of his own age I reminded him of his equals and precursors, Sophocles and Titian; he said he should not live up to the age of Sophocles—not see ninety. I don't see why he should not, if he has people about him to care for him as he should be cared for. I should like to throw up all other things on earth and devote myself to playing valet to him for the rest of his days. I should black his boots if he wore any—moi. He has given me the shock of adoration which one feels at thirteen towards great men. I am not sure that any other emotion is so durable and persistently delicious as that of worship, when your god is indubitable and incarnate before your eyes.3 I told him, as we were talking of poems and such things, that his poems had first given me inexplicable pleasure and a sort of blind relief when I was a small fellow of twelve at Eton much beaten upon and worried some twelve years back (or nearly) now. My first recollection of them is the Song of the Hours in the Iphigenia.4 Apart from their executive perfection, all those Greek poems of his always fitted on to my own way of feeling and thought infinitely more than even Tennyson's modern versions: and now I am more than ever sure that the 'Hamadryad'4 is a purer and better piece of work, from the highest point of view that art can take, than such magnificent hashes and stews of old and new with a sharp sauce of personality as 'Oenone' and 'Ulysses.' Not that I am disloyal to Tennyson, into whose church we were all in my time born and baptized as far back as we can remember at all; but he is not a Greek nor a heathen; and I imagine does not want to be; and I greatly fear believes it possible to be something better: an absurdity which should be left to the Brownings and other blatant creatures begotten on the slime of the modern chaos.

To John Nichol, 19 June [1864]">I have read all Browning's new book [&lt;i&gt;Dramatis Personae&lt;/i&gt;] since we parted; and while quite holding to all I said and say about his work as a poet I must also say—I have even had the candour to say to Rossetti—that I fully recognize the unique and most admirable power of ‘Sludge’ and ‘Caliban.’ I want to send you my full acknowledgment of this: because we talked enough about the matter, and because I have really derived such rare and keen pleasure, in the teeth of all personal or artistic feelings of dislike, from these two poems (if poems they are to be called) that I don't want you to suppose me insensible to their delightful qualities. I class both these above Blougram—not as intellectual exercises, but as samples of good work done. They are as good as Swift—i.e. not so good here, and better there; incomparably above Thackeray—and I think only a little below Chamfort and Stendhal. This last with me is higher praise than all the rest. Not less noble is the opening of St. John—but long before the end the poem is swamped in controversial shallows, and the finer features effaced under a mask of indurate theological mud. In all the rest of the book I see much that is clever and nothing that is good—much that is ingenious and nothing that is right. (“57.

Nevertheless it has given me far more labour to recollect and transcribe than it did originally to compose. But your selection of it as a piece of work more satisfactory than usual gave me so much pleasure that I was determined to send it when I could. Since writing the verses (which were literally improvised and taken down on paper one Sunday morning after breakfast) I have been told more than once, and especially by Gabriel Rossetti, that they were better than the subject. Three or four days ago I had the good fortune to be able to look well over the picture which alone put them into my head, and came to the conclusion which I had drawn at first, that whatever merit my song may have, it is not so complete in beauty, in tenderness and significance, in exquisite execution and delicate strength as Whistler's picture. Whistler himself was the first critic who so far overpraised my verse as to rank it above his own painting. I stood up against him for himself, and will, of course, against all others.&lt;/p&gt; (“83.
