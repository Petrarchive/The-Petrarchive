            <def>One of the five major poetic genres that Petrarch uses in the <title level="m">Rvf</title>, representing 2.23% of the compositions in Part I (6 of 263), .9% of those in Part II (1 of 103), and 1.91% of the entire <title level="m">Rvf</title>. There are two essential variations that we find among the 366 poems: the <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">ballata mezzana</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">ballata grande</foreign>. Both forms are read horizontally, across the charta in Petrarch’s transcription strategy. The <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">mezzana</foreign> (middle) form begins with a refrain of three verses. The <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">grande</foreign> (long) form begins with a refrain of four verses. In the last form of Vat Lat. 3195 before Petrarch’s death there are three <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">ballate mezzane</foreign>: <title level="m">Rvf</title> 55, c. 13r (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Quel foco</foreign>), <title level="m">Rvf</title> 59, c. 13v  (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Perché quel che mi trasse</foreign>), and <title level="m">Rvf</title> 324, c. 63r (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Amor, quando fioria</foreign>). A fourth <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">ballata mezzana</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c026r.xml#rvf121">Donna mi vene spesso ne la mente</ref></foreign>, resided in the position of <title level="m">Rvf</title> 121 before Petrarch’s late substitution (after 1368) of the madrigal <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c026r.xml#rvf121">Or vedi, Amor</ref></foreign> (c. 26r). <title level="m">Rvf</title> 55 and 59 present 17vv-models copied by the principal copyist on ten lines. Each contains a refrain plus two stanzas divided prosodically into four verses of a <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">mutazione</foreign> and three verses of a <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">volta</foreign>, which concludes by returning to the concluding rhyme of refrain (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">ripresa</foreign>): <title level="m">Rvf</title> 55 = XYY ABAB BYY / CDCD DYY; <title level="m">Rvf</title> 59: XyY AbAb ByY CdCdDyY. Both demonstrate significant metrical variations between hendecasyllables and <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">settenari</foreign>, using —however — the same rhyme scheme. The monostanzaic <title level="m">Rvf</title> 324 = xYY AbCB aCcYY, transcribed on seven lines, shows an additional set of variations, while the rejected <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Donna mi vene</foreign> (former 121), copied on six lines, yet another: XyX ABA BCCY. The four <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">ballate grandi</foreign> all appear in Part I: <title level="m">Rvf</title> 11, c. 2r (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c002r.xml#rvf011">Lassare il velo</ref></foreign>), <title level="m">Rvf</title> 14, c. 2v (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c002v.xml#rvf014">Occhi miei</ref></foreign>), <title level="m">Rvf</title> 63, c. 14r (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Volgendo gli occhi</foreign>), and <title level="m">Rvf</title> 149, c. 33r (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Di tempo in tempo</foreign>). <title level="m">Rvf</title> 11, 14, and 63 are all 14-v ballate transcribed on seven lines. <title level="m">Rvf</title> 11 and 14 demonstrate minor prosodic variations: <title level="m">Rvf</title> 11 = XyYX ABCBACC dDX; <title level="m">Rvf</title> 14 = XYyX ABCB ACC DdX. <title level="m">Rvf</title> 63 is entirely in hendecasyllables = XYYX ABCB ACC DDX. Transcribed on eight lines, the 16-v <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">ballata</foreign> <title level="m">Rvf</title> 149 includes additional variations: mid-verse rhyme in v. 2 and the doubling of the <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">settenario</foreign> b-rhyme in the <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">mutazioni</foreign>: X(x)YyX AbbCAbbC CDdX.

            <def>The longest of the five poetic genres used by Petrarch in the <title level="m">Rvf</title>, the canzone plays numerous roles within the <title level="m">Rvf</title>, from the poetic-biographical narrative of <title level="m">Rvf</title> 23, cc. 4r–5r (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c004r-c005r.xml#rvf023">Nel dolce tempo de la prima etade</ref></foreign>) to the spiritual redirection and conclusion of the work in the final <title level="m">Rvf</title> 366, cc. 71v–72v (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Vergine bella</foreign>). The form unites the early material construction of the <title level="m">Rvf</title> in its fair copy, bridging Fascicles I–IV so that none of these gatherings concludes at the end of a fascicle: <title level="m">Rvf</title> 37 (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Sì è debile il filo</foreign>) begins in Fascicle I, c. 8v, and concludes on c. 9v in Fascicle II; <title level="m">Rvf</title> 72 (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c016v-c018v.xml#rvf072">Gentil mia donna</ref></foreign>) begins at the end of Fascicle II on c. 16v and concludes in Fascicle III on c. 17r; we find the first 12vv of <title level="m">Rvf</title> 119 (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c024v.xml#rvf119">Una donna più bella assai</ref></foreign>) on the verso of the final charta 24 of Fascicle III, a canzone that concludes on c. 25v of Fascicle IV.
              The work’s 29 canzoni are all composed of multiple strophes, of which 27 contain a <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">congedo</foreign> (a concluding address by the poet to the poem itself [see, however, <title level="m">Rvf</title> 70, c. 15r–v [<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c015r-c015v.xml#rvf070">Lasso me! ch’i’ non so</ref></foreign>] and <title level="m">Rvf</title> 105, cc. 22v–23r [<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Mai non vo’ più cantar</foreign>] that contain no <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">congedo</foreign>). The 29 canzoni can be grouped into stanzaic variations by their metrical and material differences. These ten categories of canzoni (<hi rendition="#b">A–J</hi>) range from stanzas of 10 and 9 verses (of which there is one representative each (categories <hi rendition="#b">I</hi> and <hi rendition="#b">J</hi>), respectively <title level="m">Rvf</title> 70 and <title level="m">Rvf</title> 206, c. 40v (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">S’i’ ’l dissi mai</foreign>), to stanzas composed of 20 and 18 verses each (categories <hi rendition="#b">A</hi> and  <hi rendition="#b">B</hi>), of which there is one representative each, respectively <title level="m">Rvf</title> 23 and <title level="m">Rvf</title> 264, cc. 53r–54r (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">I’ vo pensando</foreign>). Of the six other categories, the most common form (category <hi rendition="#b">D</hi> = 34.48% of the canzoni) contains 15 verses per stanza (10 compositions: <title level="m">Rvf</title> 28, cc. 5v–6v (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c005v-c007r.xml#rvf028">O aspectata in ciel</ref></foreign>); <title level="m">Rvf</title> 71, cc. 15v–16v [<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Perché la vita</foreign>], <title level="m">Rvf</title> 72, cc. 16v–17r [<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c016v-c018v.xml#rvf072">Gentil mia donna</ref></foreign>]; <title level="m">Rvf</title> 73, cc. 17r–18r [<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c016v-c018v.xml#rvf073">Poi che per mio destino</ref></foreign>], <title level="m">Rvf</title> 105, cc. 22v–23r; <title level="m">Rvf</title> 119, cc. 24v–25r; <title level="m">Rvf</title> 135, cc. 30r–31v [<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Qual più diversa</foreign>]; <title level="m">Rvf</title> 270, cc. 55r–56r [<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Amor, se vuo’ ch’i’ torni</foreign>]; <title level="m">Rvf</title> 325, cc. 63v–64r [<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Tacer non posso</foreign>]; and <title level="m">Rvf</title> 356 [revised as <title level="m">Rvf</title> 360], cc 69v–70r [<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c069v-c070r.xml#rvf360">Quel’ antiquo mio</ref></foreign>]). The second most frequent category, category <hi rendition="#b">F</hi> = 13-verse stanzas, contains five compositions (17.24% of canzoni): <title level="m">Rvf</title> 125, c. 26v (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Se ’l pensier</foreign>); <title level="m">Rvf</title> 126, c. 27r (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Chiare, fresche et dolci acque</foreign>); <title level="m">Rvf</title> 129, c. 29r–v (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Di pensier in pensier</foreign>); <title level="m">Rvf</title> 207, c. 41r–v (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Ben mi credea</foreign>); and the final <title level="m">Rvf</title> 366, cc. 71v–72v. In category <hi rendition="#b">E</hi>, stanzas composed of 14 verses, there are three examples: <title level="m">Rvf</title> 50, c 11r–v (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Ne la stagion</foreign>); <title level="m">Rvf</title> 53, c 12r–v (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Spirto gentil</foreign>); and <title level="m">Rvf</title> 127, cc. 27r–28r (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">In quella parte</foreign>). The other three categories of canzoni all present two exemplars each: <hi rendition="#b">C</hi> = 16vv per stanza: <title level="m">Rvf</title> 37, cc. 8v–9r (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Sì è debile il filo</foreign>) and <title level="m">Rvf</title> 128, cc. 28r–29r (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Italia mia</foreign>); <hi rendition="#b">G</hi> = 12vv per stanza: <title level="m">Rvf</title> 323, cc. 62v–63r (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Standomi un giorno</foreign>), and <title level="m">Rvf</title> 331, c. 65r–v (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Solea da la fontana</foreign>); and <hi rendition="#b">H</hi> = <title level="m">Rvf</title> 268, cc. 54v–55r (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Che debb’io far?</foreign>); <title level="m">Rvf</title> 355 (revised as <title level="m">Rvf</title> 359), c. 69r (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Quando il soave</foreign>). In each category in which there is more than one exemplar (C, D, E, F, G, H) we find variations in the number of hendecasyllables to <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">settenari</foreign>. This variation forms prosodic and thematic associations among canzoni. All three of the “canzoni degli occhi” (<title level="m">Rvf</title> 71–73) utilize the same structure of the stanza and material layout. This kind of linkage functions as well at a distance: <title level="m">Rvf</title> 119 and <title level="m">Rvf</title> 356 [360] are, for example, metrical sisters, and in most early MSS that imitate Petrarch’s visual poetics are transcribed in identical formats.
              This variation and association among prosodic groups is reflected as well in the horizontal transcriptions of canzoni. While 14 out of 29 canzoni are laid out two verses per line with a single, isolated verse on its own line to conclude the stanza, the canzoni in which there is a large number of <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">settenari</foreign> also have transcriptional lines that contain three verses (see especially <title level="m">Rvf</title> 206, <title level="m">Rvf</title> 207, and <title level="m">Rvf</title> 355[revised as 359]). The 3-verse-per-line transcription of <title level="m">Rvf</title> 356[360] responds simply to the limited space that the poet-copyist had at his disposal in the binion that constitutes Fascicle XI (cc. 67–70 [see <ptr target="http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/petrarchive/visindex_fascicles.php"/>).

Lat. 3195” in STOREY, “All’interno della poetica grafico-visiva di Petrarca”, pp. 160–65 and 166–71.

All rubricated initials of the fair copy portion of the work are followed by a second, slightly smaller capital letter, a <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">maiuscoletto</foreign>: <hi rendition="#red">P</hi><hi rendition="#small-caps">e</hi>r fare una leggiadra […]. Notably the first letter of every verse that is not rubricated in both the fair and the service portions of the work is a capital letter of the same size as the <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">maiuscoletto</foreign> after the rubricated initials. In some cases, Petrarch has used — somewhat idiosyncratically — initials at mid-verse (see, for example, <title level="m">Rvf</title> 214, c. 42v <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Anzi tre dì</foreign>, v. 31: “Guardal mio stato. Ale vagheççe noue”; and <title level="m">Rvf</title> 330, c. 65r <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Quel vago</foreign>, v. 12: “Ilciel naspetta.

Most of these marks were designed to be erased or covered up by additions or erasures to be executed by the rubricator, the corrector or even the reader; <hi rendition="#b">3.</hi> occasional marks to note metrical features of the poem, including (but not consistently applied to) a rhyme that is mid-verse, the elimination of a syllable (letter) that make the verse hypersyllabic. The essential forms of <hi rendition="#b">1</hi> that the copyists of MS Vaticano Latino 3195 use are: the virgule (with variations), the <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">punctus</foreign>, the question mark, and the <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">punctus elevatus</foreign>. It should be noted that except for the question mark these forms of punctuation do not correspond to modern definitions of the comma, or the semicolon or the period.

This stark principle underlies the Storey–Walsh edition of the <title level="m">Rvf</title> as a complex network of editorial-poetic structures instilled in the single manuscript leaf and its relationship to the other components of the work that are materially connected to the principles and patterns of organization of Petrarch’s collection of “fragments”. The rich-text approach offers specialists multiple layers of information about Petrarch’s <title level="m">Fragmenta</title> without sacrificing the ultimate readability of his texts in the context of the more richly stratified environment of their most authentic forms: Vaticano Latino 3195 and the early manuscript tradition. The rich-text edition proposes through a combination of text encoding and web technologies the editorial capture of the poetic importance of the individual manuscript page as a coordinated architecture of textual presentation.</def>

            <form><orth>rubrication</orth></form>
            <def>Probably in 1368, Petrarch sent six quaternions (today cc. 1–40 and 53–60) and a binion (today cc. 61–62, 71–72) for rubrication. The result is in comparison to other medieval MSS somewhat sober, if not restrained. In addition to the first initials of each poem, the rubricator has been assigned the marking of multi-stanza poems with alternating paragraph markers (or pilcrows) for each stanza. Thus in addition to the rubricated initial of the first verse (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">capoverso</foreign>), the individual stanzas of sestine, canzoni and ballate are signaled by a red or a blue paragraph marker. Whether it is for an initial or a paragrapher marker, red is always the first color of rubrication that we find at the top of the charta. And the colors do not alternate perfectly, even on the same charta. The two stanza markers for the <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">ballata mezzana</foreign> <title level="m">Rvf</title> 55, c. 13r (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Quel foco</foreign>) are both blue, whereas the stanzas for <title level="m">Rvf</title> 59 — the same genre — c. 13v (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Perché quel che mi trasse</foreign>). 
              It is difficult to guarantee with any certainty that the two flourished initials, the V of <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Voi ch’ascoltate</foreign> (<title level="m">Rvf</title> 1, c. 1r) and the I of <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">I’ vo pensando</foreign> (<title level="m">Rvf</title> 264, c. 53r), were executed by the same hand. While the palettes and the application of gold leaf are very similar, the execution of the blue acanthus below the letter shows differences in style. Moreover, the indented space for the V on c. 1r suggests that the copyist left room for the illumination. There is no such indentation for the I on c. 53r. And while the tradition of MSS of this period, such as Vaticano Chigiano L V 176 (1362 ca), Biblioteca nazionale di Firenze Magliabechiano Cl. VI 143, and Laurenziano Martelli 12 (see <!-- <ptr target="http://vitanova.unipv.it/immagini/images.php?test=VNK&n=13"/> --> ; <ptr target="http://vitanova.unipv.it/immagini/images.php?test=VNS"/>   <!-- <ptr target="http://vitanova.unipv.it/immagini/images.php?test=VNM&n=21"/> --> ), seems to indicate that indentation for an initial I as the incipit of a section of a work such as the <title level="m">Vita Nova</title> (“In quella parte […]”) was typical, the absence of any indentation for the I of <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">I’ vo pensando</foreign> as well as the 3-line flourished I in the left margin of c. 53r, larger than the V of the entire work’s incipit leads at least to the suspicion that there was no intention in the original execution of MS Vaticano Latino 3195 to distinguish the second incipit (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">I’ vo pensando</foreign> [<title level="m">Rvf</title> 264]) with a large, or even larger, initial.</def>

          <entry xml:id="sestina">
            <form><orth>sestina</orth></form>
            <def>One of the five poetic genres that Petrarch uses in the <title level="m">Rvf</title>, the sestina constitutes a small (9 of 366 poems) but fundamental genre that is critical to the material and prosodic cohesiveness of the <title level="m">Rvf</title>. It is the sole poetic genre of the <title level="m">Rvf</title> that is designed and transcribed by the primary copyist and Petrarch to be read vertically rather than horizontally (as are the sonnet, the <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">ballata</foreign>, the madrigal, and the canzone). The uniqueness of its role in the work is underscored by the fact that in the prosodic conceptualization of the form in Due- and Trecento, the sestina is considered to be simply a canzone. In his final tally of the canzoni in the <title level="m">Rvf</title> in the left margin of c. 72v, Petrarch counts 38 (29 canzoni and 9 sestine) but distinguishes them in their essential transcription. 
              Petrarch establishes an additional contrast in his heightening of the effect of the sestina by always pairing a sestina on the same charta with a sonnet. The sestina’s vertical transcription (down column 1 and then down column 2) contrasts significantly with the sonnet’s horizontal reading strategy across the two columns. 
              The rhyme scheme of the sestina depends less upon the internal prosody of each stanza of six verses (ABCDEF) than the complex technical reformulation of the same rhyme words in a formulaic scheme that after six stanzas would in theory return to the original sequence. The technical challenge of the sestina is to follow this positional sequencing using exactly the same rhyme words. As the stanzas progress, the sixth rhyme of the stanza always becomes the first rhyme of the next stanza. Rhyme word 1 becomes the rhyme of v. 2. The rhyme word of verse 2 becomes moves to the fourth verse of the next stanza; the third to the sixth and final verse; the fourth to the fifth; and the fifth to the third verse, thus: 6 > 1 | 1 > 2 | 2 > 4 | 3 > 6 | 4 > 5 | 5 > 3.
              There are eight sestine in Part I (3.04% of the 263 compositions) and a sole double sestina in Part II: <title level="m">Rvf</title> 22, c. 3v (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c003v.xml#rvf022">A qualunque animale</ref></foreign>, paired with <title level="m">Rvf</title> 21 <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c003v.xml#rvf021">Mille fiate</ref></foreign>); <title level="m">Rvf</title> 30, c. 7v (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Giovene donna</foreign>, paired with <title level="m">Rvf</title> 31 <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Questa anima</foreign>); <title level="m">Rvf</title> 66, c. 14v (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c014v.xml#rvf066">L’aere gravato</ref></foreign>, paired with <title level="m">Rvf</title> 67 <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c014v.xml#rvf067">Del mar Tirreno</ref></foreign>); <title level="m">Rvf</title> 80, c. 19r (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c019r.xml#rvf080">Chi è fermato</ref></foreign>, paired with <title level="m">Rvf</title> 81 <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c019r.xml#rvf081">Io son sì stanco</ref></foreign>); <title level="m">Rvf</title> 142, c. 32r–v (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">A la dolce ombra</foreign>, paired with <title level="m">Rvf</title> 140 <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Amor che nel penser mio</foreign> and <title level="m">Rvf</title> 141 <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Come talora</foreign>); <title level="m">Rvf</title> 214, c. 42v (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Anzi tre dì</foreign>, paired with <title level="m">Rvf</title> 215 <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">In nobil sangue</foreign>); <title level="m">Rvf</title> 237, c. 45v (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Non à tanti animali</foreign>, paired with <title level="m">Rvf</title> 236 <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Amor io fallo</foreign>); <title level="m">Rvf</title> 239, c. 46r (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Là ver’ l’aurora</foreign>, paired with <title level="m">Rvf</title> 238 <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Real natura</foreign>); and the double sestina <title level="m">Rvf</title> 332, cc. 65v–66r (see “Genere-sestina” in STOREY, “All’interno della poetica grafico-visiva di Petrarca”, pp. 155–57; as well as BAROLINI 2006. “The Making of a Lyric Sequence: Time and Narrative in Petrarch’s <title level="m">Rerum vulgarium fragmenta</title>”, now in <title level="m">Dante and the Origins of Italian Literary Culture</title>, pp. 193–223).

            <def>The most numerous of the five poetic genres used by Petrarch in the <title level="m">Rvf</title>, the sonnet makes up 85.55% of the compositions of Part I (225 of 263 poems), 89.32% of Part II (92 of 103 poems), and 86.61% of the entire <title level="m">Rvf</title> (317 of 366 poems). The “sonnet page”, one side of a charta that is comprised of four sonnets on 31 transcriptional lines (7+1+7+1+7+1+7), is the essential building block of the <title level="m">Rvf</title>. There are 42 “sonnet pages” in Part I (= 168 sonnets) and 20 “sonnet pages” in Part II (= 80 sonnets). Chartae on which we find mixtures of sonnets and sestine, as well as sonnets and ballate, madrigals and even canzoni, account for the collocation of the remaining 69 sonnets. 
              The sonnet is a 14-v composition transcribed in Petrarch’s holograph (Vat. Lat. 3195) on seven lines in a single text block, 2 verses per line. Throughout all the potential prosodic and syntactic variations that Petrarch’s 317 sonnets (225 in Part I and 92 in Part II) demonstrate, the transcriptional poetics are always the same. The two quatrains appear on the first four lines and the two <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">terzine</foreign> (vv. 9–14) on the concluding three lines, two verses per line. While numerous variations in the lengths of syntactic construction of the hendecasyllables are possible and there is some variation in the rhyme schemes as well, common constructions of Petrarch’s sonnets, always in hendecasyllables, are: ABBA ABBA CDC DCD; ABBA ABBA CDE DCE; and ABBA ABBA CDE CDE. 
              Petrarch’s attention to the sonnet as the backbone of his work is borne out in the apparently frequent count he took of them during the genesis of the MS Vaticano Latino 3195, inserting roman numerals in the margins to keep count. Of particular note is the final count on c. 71r, next to the final sonnet in the sequence: <title level="m">Rvf</title> 365 [revised as <title level="m">Rvf</title> 353]: “( CCC.XIJ”. As S. Zamponi has pointed out, the XIJ of CCCXIJ is written in a darker ink, added to the original CCC. The CCCXII would account for the 21 sonnets added in the additional binion (Fascicle XI) and inserted into Fascicle IX (cc. 61–62 | 71–72), but not the four sonnets (<title level="m">Rvf</title> 260–263) added to the final binion (Fascicle VII, cc. 49–52) after Fascicle VI (cc. 41–48), nor for the final sonnet added to c. 48v of Fascicle VI: <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Cercato ò sempre solitaria vita</foreign> (<title level="m">Rvf</title> 259). Thus we can deduce that the last sonnets Petrarch adds to the <title level="m">Fragmenta</title> are at the end of Part I. See “Genere-sonetto” in STOREY, “All’interno della poetica grafico-visiva di Petrarca”, pp. 152–55; ZAMPONI, “Il libro del Canzoniere: Modelli, strutture, funzioni”, pp. 13–72.)

            <def>The use of blank space(s) in the layout of the <title level="m">Rvf</title> often serves different forms of punctuation both internally within individual poems and externally between poems and even within longer groupings. On cc. 3v, 7v, 14v, 19r, 41v, 45v, 46r the author/copyist regularly inserts spaces to distinguish between the reading strategies of the sonnet and the sestina, which as a rule inhabit the same charta. In each instance, the five to seven blank lines in the right column visually distinguish between the sonnet’s horizontal double verses (two verses per transcriptional line) and the sestina’s vertical transcriptional formula of unequal columns of 22+17 or 23+16 verses. On c. 32r–v, Petrarch’s copyist attempts to rectify the anomalous layout of vv. 1–30 of <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">A la dolce ombra de le belle frondi</foreign> (<title level="m">Rvf</title> 142), divided equally on c. 32r in two columns of fifteen verses each, by imitating a similar, staggered effect on c. 32v, leaving three blank lines in the right column. The constant of this sestina-specific space, which we define as “descriptive sestina space” allows for few alternatives.
              Petrarch also uses space as a placeholder for postponed compositional and transcriptional decisions, such as the blank space left by the copyist on c. 37r and later used by Petrarch himself to insert <title level="m">Rvf</title> 179, <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Geri, quando talor meco s’adira</foreign>. 			
              A “stop space” defines closure within a grouping or cluster of poems or, generally, in the macrotext. The unruled c. 52v has the same function as the blank charta used in fourteenth-century copies of the <title level="m">Commedia</title> to separate, for example, the <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Inferno</foreign> from the <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Purgatorio</foreign>. The copyist uses a similar divisional “stop space” between c. 22r and 22v to mark a significant macrotextual pause between the sonnet <title level="m">Rvf</title> 104 (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">L’aspectata vertù</foreign>) and the canzone <title level="m">Rvf</title> 105 (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c022v-c023r.xml#rvf105">Mai non vo’ più cantar</ref></foreign>). The blank space of eight transcriptional lines at the bottom of c. 22r could easily have held the first twelve verses of <title level="m">Rvf</title> 105’s first fifteen-verse strophe, just as c. 24v’s final eight lines convey the first twelve verses of the first fifteen-verse strophe of the canzone <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c024v.xml#rvf119">Una donna più bella</ref></foreign> (<title level="m">Rvf</title> 119). The eight blank lines at the bottom of c. 22r, where one might have expected a sonnet or a <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">ballata</foreign> or the stanza of a canzone, thwart the anticipation of the reader and the trajectory of the macrotext, and announce a full stop before the “manifesto” of a fundamental change: “Mai non vo’ più cantar com’io soleva”.

            <def>In the Petr<hi rendition="#i">archive</hi> we use this term and assign code to the structure to denote Petrarch’s use of the writing space of most of the chartae of the partial holograph MS Vaticano Latino 3195. His visual poetics in this codex depend upon a 31-line canvas. His basic “sonnet page”, one side of a charta that contains four sonnets — each written on seven lines and each separated from the next by a blank space (7+1+7+1+7+1+7), and his “sonnet+sestina page” (7+1+23) constitute the primary formulae for the 31-line canvas. 43.3% of all the used chartae in Part I and half of Part II are “sonnet pages”. There are seven “sonnet+sestina pages” in Part I. Just over half of the <title level="m">Rvf</title> (50.36%) is made up of these two kinds of structured charta. At the same time, variations in the actual use of all the transcriptional lines available will serve as an important model. Charta 13r, that contains a multi-stanza <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">ballata mezzana</foreign> (<title level="m">Rvf</title> 55), two sonnets (<title level="m">Rvf</title> 56 and 57), and the <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">quartine</foreign> of a third sonnet (<title level="m">Rvf</title> 58, 1–8) are transcribed on 10+1+7+1+7+1+4 lines. On charta 11v the canzone <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Ne la stagion</foreign> (<title level="m">Rvf</title> 50, vv 47–67) concludes on 16 lines and is then followed by the sonnet <title level="m">Rvf</title> 51 (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Poco era ad appressarsi</foreign>) and the madrigal <title level="m">Rvf</title> 52 (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Non al suo amante</foreign>) on five lines: 16+2+7+1+5. There is also a small number of chartae on which Petrarch’s copyist is forced by the visual poetics of the surrounding chartae to use 32 lines (see, for example, c. 33r) and in others to use fewer lines (see, for example, c. 29v [28 lines] and c. 31r [30 lines]). Charta 18r–v serves, however, as a reminder of the planning and adjustments that the transcription had to undergo in order to respect essential features of the layout of the poems, especially the sonnets and the sonnet+sestina combination. Concluding the last 14 verses of canzone <title level="m">Rvf</title> 73 (vv. 80–93) on 8 lines of c. 18r, the copyist skips one line and transcribes two sonnets (<title level="m">Rvf</title> 74 and <title level="m">Rvf</title> 75) = 8+1+7+1+7+1. He now has six lines left in his 31-line transcriptional canvas, but must copy sonnet <title level="m">Rvf</title> 76 (<foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i"><ref target="c016v-c018v.xml#rvf076">Amor con sue promesse lusingando</ref></foreign>). Rather than extending the transcriptional field to 32, he copies 12 of the sonnet’s 14 verses on 6 lines, and completes the sonnet’s vv. 13–14 on the verso of c. 18 on a single transcriptional line, infringing upon one of the tendencies of the material form of the work to not divide short poems on two chartae. Charta 18v, which contains only three sonnets (<title level="m">Rvf</title> 77, 78, and 79) to accommodate the integral “sonnet+sestina page” of c. 19r, was already destined to have only 23 of its lines used (7+1+7+1+7). With the additional line and blank space, 25 of c. 18v’s 31-transcriptional line canvas are employed, leaving six lines blank. But the required contrast between the sonnet’s (<title level="m">Rvf</title> 81) and the sestina’s (<title level="m">Rvf</title> 80) reading strategies is guaranteed by the mise en page of c. 18r–v.</def>

            <def>The interconnectedness between the poetic text and its layout on the manuscript page or charta. The principle, which was first studied by Storey in 1981 in a <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">sonetto rinterzato</foreign> — <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Coralment’ò me stesso in ira</foreign> — by Monte Andrea da Firenze in the late thirteenth-century codex Vaticano Latino 3793, developed from the analysis of a scribal error in the poem that demonstrated that the antegraph from which the copyist took his copy was structured on transcriptional lines designed to highlight the unusual split-word rhymes in ca-ppo and a-qua (now in STOREY, <title level="m">Transcription and Visual Poetics</title>, pp. 71–109). As in the case of Monte’s <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">Coralment’ò</foreign>, visual poetics of a given composition document the perceptual differences between the aural and the visual interpretative acts. While thirteenth-century Tuscans might have heard the sonnet as a 14-v performance organized around rhyme and prosody, the copyist and reader could examine the poet’s text within its physical construction that tended to group the <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">quartine</foreign> and distinguish between the two <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">terzine</foreign>. Petrarch’s innovative graphological formula for the sonnet proposed a balanced structure that visually integrated the <foreign xml:lang="it" rendition="#i">terzine</foreign> and allowed for numerous variations in syntactic phrasing that accommodate, for example, in <title level="m">Rvf</title> 134 (c. 30v) the extension of the oxymoron — without the sonnet’s traditional antithesis — for 13 of the sonnet’s 14 verses, to conclude in v 14 with the definition of the lover’s contrasting conditions as a single state: “In questo stato son, donna, per voi”.
              Petrarch’s visual poetics depend not only on the repeated transcriptional formulae of the poems and their plays of anafora and rhetorical prowess and balance, but also on the layout of entire groupings that depend on similar prosodic features and then sudden contrast and changes in direction, literally in the reading strategy and in the narrative sequencing of the collection’s units that are at times only loosely connected. 
              This feat of creating a poetics that is so closely tied to the visual presentation of its verses in five separate genres is at once a representative of Petrarch’s poetic-editorial genius and the extraordinary influence of his highly structured ‘canzoniere’ as a poetic-editorial model for a new kind of book of poetry in Western literature, in which poetry is linked to its material container.
