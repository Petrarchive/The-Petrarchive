Poor preparation, specifically over-cooking, not only tenderizes and discolors greens especially, but what is by far more important, the health-restoring minerals and vitamins are forever being deposited in the pot-liquor which, under the usual procedure of preparing vegetables, contains far more of the nutrients than food recently cooked and which is too often discarded as waste. (Indeed, it would be far better generally to discard the cooked vegetables and drink the pot-liquor.)</p><p>In readying the freshly collected herbs for table use, these rules should be adhered to: </p><ol><li class="item">Collect only as much as is needed for the day’s meals.</li><li class="item">Remove all dried leaves, coarse stalks, and adhering soil.</li><li class="item">Wash twice with cold water only and allow to drain.</li><li class="item">Store in a cool place or refrigerator.</li><li class="item">Use as soon as possible or prepare immediately before mealtime.</li></ol></div><!--TEI back--><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><div class="footer"><!--standard links to project, institution etc--><a class="plain" href="/">Home</a> </div><address>Date: 2015-10-01<br /><!--
