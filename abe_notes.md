 c007R - The dblvrs following single should also be indented outside body.... is this systemic?

 rvf-50 c011r-c011v - Compared to Facs.... Pillcrow in wrong location. should be on rvf line 57 but is in 59.

 rvf-55&59 c013r-c013v & rvf-63 c014r line 5 - Example where the pillcrow is not indented due to it being in an abnormal position. Usually the 1st 'lg' of each type='ballata_grande' is indented. In this case, the pillcrow is on the 3rd 'lg'. Should we add a class to signify pillcrow indentation?

 rvf-71 line 97 c016v in c015r-c018v - added class 'no-indent' for anamoly case where first 'lg' should NOT be indented

 rvf-126 line 2nd to last line c027r in c027r-c29v - I think this is a typo? Second to last line should have pillcrow?
